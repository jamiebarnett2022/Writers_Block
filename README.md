# Writers_Block

A Flask-Python based web app designed to help challenge periods of writer's block. The application uses SQL to set up a user registration system and a database for storing writing sessions. The app functions
to challenge writer's block through a speed game, where the user sets a goal wordcount and WPM, and keeps typing until they dip below their goal WPM too long or reach their goal wordcount. Once this session
has finished, they can choose to start over or save their work. Users can go back to past writing sessions and edit their work as much as they want.
